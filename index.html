            <h2> A Rainy Night By: Jake    </h2>
            <h4> Date: June 14, 2024       </h4>

            <p> After Jake bought his alternative childhood car, Him and his mom had a fight about a Porsche he bought During the summer of last year, his father was stressed out, if Jake's Mother figures out, he bought a sports car, she will be really mad. Jake's Father always had a favorite car brand 
                He loved how Porsche made their cars; he always talks about how cool Porsche's were, even his grandfather had a Porsche before. When He bought the car, Jake's Father warned about buying stuff that those do not help the family. Jake's mother won't be so happy, Shes bossy and  
                tends to be super angry at stuff that is pointless. its 2024 and she hasn't figured out what he bought last year, but she was getting really suspicious. The constant loud noise during the night and also lots of noise in the garage. one day Jake's Sister found the Yellow Porsche and called Her Mother 
                She was super angry that she called Jake and his father, they were busted. They didn't know what's about to happen, they didn't feel like coming to talk to her, but they had to anyway, they didn't know what the mother would do to the car. When they came home, she immediately looks at Jake and ignored the father 
                She shouted at Jake Asking why he bought a sports car instead of a SUV or a Pickup, they already have a personal car of the mother and a family van. So, it made sense to buy his own personal car, then Jake's Sister proceeded to lie about not giving her a car for her birthday as he promised, but the mother  
                didn't care about the birthday gift that was "Promised" all she cared about was the purchase of the car, how long they had been hiding this car. The Father admitted that he bought the car During the summer of July, He look at Jake She complained how he was not useful, that was a complete lie. He has been  
                helping the family ever since the age of 14, Jake replied, " The car was not supposing the help the family, I have been helping ever since I turned 14, I deserved a reward besides you barely help us both out, most of this stuff you're standing on was bought by us" Thats where she snapped 
                She screamed so hard, even the neighbors could hear her. to pack your stuff and leave, she was serious she threatened to call the cops and even lie to the cops, they had no choice they didn't want to cop to get involved into family issues, so they started packing up even the daughter felt 
                uncomfortable living alone with her so she decided to come with the two but promised not to put them under a lot of pressure or annoy them. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                As they left the only home they had and taking the Porsche and the Family van they visited a harbor that there Grandfather use to fish, Thats when the photo you see here was taken. As of right now, Police have been investiging what happen since the Father posted what happened on social media and blew up, strangers have reported the police
                , as the police have heard, physical violence was used on the son, as of right now, they are living on there Mother's Grandmother and Father. And they have alot of words for the mother
